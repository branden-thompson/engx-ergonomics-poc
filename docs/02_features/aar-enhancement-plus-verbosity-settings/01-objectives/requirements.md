# Requirements Specification - AAR Enhancement + Verbosity Settings

## Feature Classification
- **Type**: LEVEL-1 SEV-0 Enhancement
- **Category**: Core CLI Infrastructure
- **Priority**: High (SEV-0)
- **Branch**: feature/aar-enhancement-plus-verbosity-settings

## Primary Requirements

### 1. After-Action Report (AAR) Enhancement
**Requirement**: Generate comprehensive after-action summary similar to other build tools
- **Context**: Current system lacks post-execution summary and guidance
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Provide execution summary with timing and status
  - Generate actionable next steps for engineers
  - Include relevant troubleshooting information
  - Present in professional, build-tool-style format

### 2. Verbosity Settings System
**Requirement**: Add configurable output verbosity options
- **Context**: Engineers need different levels of information based on context
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Five verbosity levels (quiet, concise, default, verbose, debug)
  - Command-line flags to control output level
  - Default setting when no option provided
  - Apply to progress view and all future views

### 3. System Integration
**Requirement**: Seamless integration with existing CLI infrastructure
- **Context**: Must work with current prompt and TUI systems
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Backward compatibility with existing functionality
  - Consistent flag patterns with CLI conventions
  - Performance impact minimized

## Acceptance Criteria

### AAR Enhancement
- [ ] Post-execution summary displays timing, status, and key metrics
- [ ] Next steps are contextually relevant and actionable
- [ ] Troubleshooting guidance included for failed operations
- [ ] Professional presentation matching industry build tools

### Verbosity System
- [ ] Five verbosity levels implemented (quiet, concise, default, verbose, debug)
- [ ] Command-line flags functional: `--quiet`, `--concise`, `--verbose`, `--debug`
- [ ] Default behavior maintains current user experience
- [ ] All output respects verbosity settings

### Integration
- [ ] Existing functionality unchanged
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Documentation complete per SEV-0 requirements

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Maintain existing CLI architecture patterns
- No breaking changes to current command interface
- Memory usage must remain efficient
- Terminal compatibility across platforms

### Business Constraints
- Feature must enhance developer productivity
- Implementation timeline aligned with project roadmap
- Documentation must meet SEV-0 standards (ALL folders + 80% optional files)

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- Current CLI command structure
- TUI rendering system
- Configuration management
- Progress tracking infrastructure

### External Dependencies
- Go standard library for flag parsing
- Existing Bubble Tea framework
- Terminal capability detection
