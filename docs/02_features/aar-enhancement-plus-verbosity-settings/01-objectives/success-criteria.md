# Success Criteria - AAR Enhancement + Verbosity Settings

## Definition of Done

### Primary Success Criteria

#### AAR Enhancement
1. **Post-Execution Summary**
   - [ ] Professional summary displayed after TUI completion
   - [ ] Execution timing (total duration, key milestones)
   - [ ] Step completion status with success/failure indicators
   - [ ] Resource metrics (if applicable)

2. **Next Steps Generation**
   - [ ] Contextually relevant next actions based on created project
   - [ ] Development workflow suggestions
   - [ ] Common commands for immediate use
   - [ ] Links to relevant documentation or resources

3. **Troubleshooting Support**
   - [ ] Failure analysis for any failed steps
   - [ ] Suggested remediation actions
   - [ ] Common issue identification
   - [ ] Support contact information or resources

#### Verbosity System
1. **Multi-Level Output Control**
   - [ ] Quiet mode: Minimal essential output only
   - [ ] Normal mode: Current behavior (default)
   - [ ] Verbose mode: Enhanced detail and progress information
   - [ ] Debug mode: Comprehensive technical information

2. **Flag Implementation**
   - [ ] `--quiet` / `-q`: Suppress non-essential output
   - [ ] `--verbose` / `-v`: Enhanced detail
   - [ ] `--debug`: Maximum information
   - [ ] Default behavior unchanged

3. **Output Consistency**
   - [ ] All TUI components respect verbosity settings
   - [ ] Progress renderer adapts to verbosity level
   - [ ] AAR output scales with verbosity setting
   - [ ] Error messages maintain appropriate detail level

### Quality Gates (SEV-0 Requirements)

#### Documentation Completeness
- [ ] All 7 folders populated with required content
- [ ] 80% of optional documentation files completed
- [ ] Architecture diagrams and technical specifications
- [ ] User experience flows and examples

#### Testing Coverage
- [ ] Unit tests for verbosity flag handling
- [ ] Integration tests for AAR generation
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility validation
- [ ] Performance regression testing

#### Performance Standards
- [ ] No measurable impact on TUI execution time
- [ ] AAR generation completes within 100ms
- [ ] Memory usage increase < 5MB
- [ ] Terminal rendering remains responsive

#### User Experience Standards
- [ ] AAR provides clear value to developers
- [ ] Verbosity levels meet different use case needs
- [ ] Output remains professional and polished
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained 100%

### Acceptance Validation

#### Functional Validation
1. **AAR Content Quality**
   - Summary accurately reflects execution
   - Next steps are actionable and relevant
   - Timing information is precise
   - Failure analysis is helpful

2. **Verbosity Effectiveness**
   - Each level serves distinct use cases
   - Information density appropriate for level
   - No critical information lost in quiet mode
   - Debug mode provides sufficient detail for troubleshooting

3. **System Integration**
   - No regressions in existing functionality
   - Clean integration with current CLI patterns
   - Consistent behavior across all commands
   - Proper error handling at all levels

#### Business Validation
1. **Developer Productivity**
   - AAR reduces time to next action
   - Verbosity levels support different workflows
   - Professional presentation enhances tool perception
   - Clear value proposition demonstrated

2. **Tool Ecosystem Fit**
   - Output style matches industry standards
   - Integration friendly with CI/CD systems
   - Supports both interactive and automated use
   - Extensible for future enhancements

### Success Metrics

#### Quantitative Metrics
- Zero regressions in existing test suite
- AAR generation time < 100ms
- Memory footprint increase < 5MB
- 100% backward compatibility

#### Qualitative Metrics
- Professional, build-tool-quality AAR output
- Clear, actionable next steps
- Appropriate verbosity level differentiation
- Seamless integration with existing UX

### Failure Criteria

#### Hard Failures (Must Fix)
- Any regression in existing functionality
- Performance degradation exceeding limits
- Breaking changes to CLI interface
- Cross-platform compatibility issues

#### Soft Failures (Should Address)
- AAR output unclear or unhelpful
- Verbosity levels not sufficiently differentiated
- Poor integration with development workflows
- Subpar professional presentation

## Validation Process
