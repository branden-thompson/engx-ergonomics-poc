## MISSION BRIEFING

Create a comprehensive failure injection system ("Chaos Marine") that can simulate real-world errors, failures, and adverse conditions to test and improve user experience patterns, error messages, and recovery flows.

---

## CORE REQUIREMENTS

### 1. COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE
```bash
# Activation
engx create MyApp --chaos-marine [--aggressiveness-level]

# Aggressiveness Levels
--off            # 0% failure rate (explicit disable)
(no flag)        # 0.1% base failure rate (default)
--scout          # 0.5% failure rate
--aggressive     # 1% failure rate
--invasive       # 5% failure rate
--apocalyptic    # 10% failure rate
```

### 2. FAILURE INJECTION SCENARIOS

#### Network Simulation
- **Slow network**: Introduce artificial delays (200ms-5s)
- **Intermittent connectivity**: Random connection drops
- **No network**: Complete network failure simulation
- **Timeout scenarios**: DNS resolution failures, connection timeouts

#### Resource Simulation
- **Missing dependencies**: Simulate package/binary not found
- **Permission errors**: File system access denied scenarios
- **Disk space**: Insufficient storage simulation
- **Memory constraints**: High memory usage simulation

#### Performance Simulation
- **High CPU load**: Artificial processing delays
- **I/O bottlenecks**: Slow file system operations
- **Memory pressure**: Simulate low memory conditions
- **Process contention**: Resource competition scenarios

#### Catastrophic Failures
- **Process crashes**: Unexpected termination simulation
- **Corrupted output**: Malformed data generation
- **Configuration corruption**: Invalid config file simulation
- **System-level errors**: Platform-specific failure modes

### 3. ADAPTIVE MONITORING & INTELLIGENCE

#### User Response Tracking
- Monitor user inputs following error scenarios
- Track success/failure of remediation attempts
- Analyze user behavior patterns during error recovery
- Measure time-to-resolution for different error types

#### Dynamic Adjustment
- Increase failure likelihood if user handles errors well
- Decrease aggressiveness if user struggles with recovery
- Chain related failures based on user response patterns
- Simulate cascade failures when remediation steps fail

#### Contextual Awareness
- Consider current system state for realistic failures
- Avoid contradictory error scenarios
- Respect user's demonstrated skill level
- Maintain narrative consistency across failure chain

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS

### 1. UNIVERSAL INTEGRATION
- **All Components Observable**: Every system component must be chaos-injectable
- **Modular Injection Points**: Clean interfaces for failure insertion
- **Future-Proof Design**: Support for all future features and commands
- **Non-Intrusive**: Zero impact when chaos mode is disabled

### 2. INJECTION FRAMEWORK
```go
// Core injection interface
type ChaosInjector interface {
    ShouldInject(operation string) bool
    InjectFailure(operation string, scenario FailureScenario) error
    ReportOutcome(operation string, success bool, duration time.Duration)
}

// Injectable operation points
type OperationPoint struct {
    Name        string
    Component   string
    Phase       ExecutionPhase
    Criticality ImpactLevel
}
```

### 3. SCENARIO ENGINE
- **Probability-Based**: Configurable failure rates per operation
- **Scenario Library**: Extensible catalog of failure modes
- **Context-Sensitive**: Realistic failure combinations
- **Recovery Testing**: Validate user remediation flows

### 4. OBSERVABILITY & ANALYTICS
- **Injection Logging**: Detailed failure injection audit trail
- **User Journey Tracking**: Complete error-to-resolution flow analysis
- **Performance Impact**: Measure chaos overhead on system performance
- **Recovery Metrics**: Success rates of different error handling approaches

## SYSTEM INTEGRATION POINTS

### Current System Analysis
Based on codebase analysis, key injection points identified:

#### Command Layer (`internal/commands/create.go`)
- Command initialization and flag parsing
- User configuration gathering
- TUI program lifecycle management

#### Progress Simulation (`internal/simulation/progress/tracker.go`)
- Individual step execution (already has ErrorRate field!)
- Duration simulation and timing
- Step completion and failure handling

#### Error Scenarios (`internal/simulation/errors/scenarios.go`)
- Existing error scenario framework (excellent foundation!)
- Error message formatting and display
- Recovery action suggestions

#### TUI Components (`internal/tui/`)
- Prompt handling and user input collection
- Progress display and state management
- Error state rendering and user feedback

#### Configuration System (`internal/config/`)
- User configuration loading and validation
- Verbosity level management
- System capability detection

## CONSTRAINT REQUIREMENTS

### 1. ENTRY POINT PROTECTION
- **Never fail initial command**: `engx [cmd] ...` must always start successfully
- **Chaos activation safe**: --chaos-marine flag parsing cannot fail
- **Configuration loading**: Basic system startup must be reliable

### 2. USER EXPERIENCE FOCUS
- **Realistic scenarios**: Failures must reflect real-world conditions
- **Educational value**: Errors should teach proper recovery techniques
- **Progressive difficulty**: Respect user's demonstrated competence level
- **Recovery validation**: Test effectiveness of suggested remediation steps

### 3. EXTENSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
- **Plugin Architecture**: Support for custom failure scenarios
- **Scenario Composition**: Complex multi-stage failure chains
- **Telemetry Integration**: Export chaos data for analysis
- **Developer Tools**: Injection testing and scenario development utilities
