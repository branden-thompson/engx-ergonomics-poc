# User Config Prompts Feature - Requirements Document
**üõ©Ô∏è BRTOPS RCC Phase - Requirements & Context Collection**

## FEATURE CLASSIFICATION
- **Type**: MAJOR FEATURE SEV-0
- **Name**: user-config-prompts
- **Focus**: Interactive prompting system for dynamic component selection
- **Status**: RCC Phase - Requirements Gathering

## MISSION OBJECTIVE
Implement an interactive prompting system that allows users to configure which application components get installed during `engx create`, demonstrating best practices for terminal-based configuration flows for engineering teams building the real tool.

## CORE REQUIREMENTS

### Interactive Prompting Flow
The system shall present users with configuration choices that determine which components are installed:

```bash
engx create MyApp
# Triggers interactive prompts:
# 1. Template Selection (TypeScript, JavaScript, Minimal)
# 2. Development Features (Testing, Linting, Hot Reload)
# 3. Production Features (Docker, CI/CD, Monitoring)
# 4. Integration Selection (APIs, Databases, Auth)
# 5. Deployment Targets (Local, Staging, Production)
```

### Component Selection Logic
Based on user selections, the system shall conditionally include/exclude:

#### Core Technologies (Always Included)
- React Framework
- Build System (Vite/Webpack)
- Package Manager (npm/yarn)

#### Conditional Components by Category
1. **Development Tools**
   - Testing Frameworks (Jest, Cypress, Playwright)
   - Code Quality (ESLint, Prettier, Husky)
   - Development Server (Hot reload, debugging)

2. **Production Setup**
   - Containerization (Docker, docker-compose)
   - CI/CD Pipelines (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps)
   - Monitoring (Error tracking, analytics)

3. **ENGX Integrations**
   - CREWS API (Team collaboration)
   - LI Catalog API (Component library)
   - GitHub Actions (Deployment automation)

4. **Quality & Testing**
   - Unit Testing (Jest, React Testing Library)
   - E2E Testing (Cypress, Playwright)
   - Performance Testing (Lighthouse, Web Vitals)

### User Experience Requirements

#### Prompt Design Patterns
- **Multi-select Lists**: For choosing multiple components
- **Single-select Options**: For mutually exclusive choices
- **Yes/No Confirmations**: For binary decisions
- **Smart Defaults**: Pre-selected common configurations
- **Skip Options**: Quick setup with sensible defaults

#### Visual Design Standards
- **Clear Categories**: Grouped related options
- **Help Text**: Context for each choice
- **Dependencies**: Show component relationships
- **Progress Indication**: Current step in configuration
- **Cancellation**: Allow backing out gracefully

### Engineering Demonstration Goals

#### Interaction Pattern Showcase
1. **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, add complexity
2. **Contextual Help**: Inline explanations and examples
3. **Validation Feedback**: Real-time input validation
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of invalid inputs
5. **Configuration Summary**: Review selections before proceeding

#### Best Practices for Real Implementation
- **Consistent Styling**: Professional, branded appearance
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full accessibility support
- **Responsive Design**: Works in various terminal sizes
- **Performance**: Fast rendering and smooth interactions
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new prompts and options

## TECHNICAL INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS

### Bubble Tea TUI Components
- **Multi-select Lists**: Using bubbles list component
- **Text Inputs**: For custom values and names
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: For important decisions
- **Progress Indicators**: Show configuration progress
- **Help Panels**: Contextual assistance

### Configuration Management
- **State Persistence**: Remember selections during session
- **Config Generation**: Create .engx/config.yaml from choices
- **Flag Override**: Command-line flags bypass prompts
- **Template Integration**: Choices affect component installation

### Component Installation Logic
- **Dynamic Phase Adjustment**: Modify installation steps based on selections
- **Conditional Dependencies**: Install only selected components
- **Progress Simulation**: Realistic timing for chosen components
- **Status Updates**: Clear feedback on what's being installed

## USER SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: New Developer (Guided Setup)
```
User: engx create MyFirstApp
System: Welcomes user, explains configuration process
System: Presents template choices with explanations
System: Guides through development vs production features
System: Shows final configuration summary
System: Proceeds with installation of selected components
```

### Scenario 2: Experienced Developer (Quick Setup)
```
User: engx create ProductionApp --template=typescript --production
System: Skips basic prompts, focuses on production-specific choices
System: Presents advanced configuration options
System: Confirms production-ready setup
System: Installs full production component stack
```

### Scenario 3: Custom Configuration
```
User: engx create CustomApp
System: Presents all configuration categories
User: Selects specific testing frameworks, skips monitoring
User: Chooses custom API integrations
System: Validates configuration for compatibility
System: Installs only selected components
```
